> Accurate and efficient modeling of the dynamics of binary black
> holes (BBHs) is crucial to their detection through gravitational
> waves (GWs), with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, and LISA in the future. Solving
> the dynamics of a BBH system with arbitrary parameters without
> simplifications (like orbit- or precession-averaging) in closed-form
> is one of the most challenging problems for the GW community. One
> potential approach is using canonical perturbation theory which
> constructs perturbed action-angle variables from the unperturbed
> ones of an integrable Hamiltonian system. Having action-angle
> variables of the integrable 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) BBH system is
> therefore imperative. In this paper, we continue the work initiated
> by two of us in
> [arXiv:2012.06586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06586), where we
> presented four out of five actions of a BBH system with arbitrary
> eccentricity, masses, and spins, at 1.5PN order. Here we compute the
> remaining fifth action using a novel method of extending the phase
> space by introducing unmeasurable phase space coordinates. We detail
> how to compute all the frequencies, and sketch how to explicitly
> transform to angle variables, which analytically solves the dynamics
> at 1.5PN. This lays the groundwork to analytically solve the
> conservative dynamics of the BBH system with arbitrary masses,
> spins, and eccentricity, at higher PN order, by using canonical
> perturbation theory.
